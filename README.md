As a software developer for small businesses, a lot of the work I produce for my clients is confidential. 

However, if you are interested in my work for businesses, my first client from 2019 has allowed me to publish the first edition of the management software I created for them. This software is no longer in use as of 2025. To the best of my knowledge, all files are safe to download.
